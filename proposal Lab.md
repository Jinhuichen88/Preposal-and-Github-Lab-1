# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
  
convenience Modification 


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project is Modification MODs, such as create new internal and external skills, but most likely adding purchasable items, modifying specific attributes of items.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My game modifier mod can change the gold coins and attributes of the game. Also it changes the shop to allow you to buy skills that are only available later in the game. This can make the game easier. Its feature is that it is convenient. You only need to subscribe to the mod that I uploaded on the Steam workshop to make it work in the game.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not sure.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

No, I am working alone.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, my final project will be having to make a new skill on the game mod.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I felt like my final project would accomplish the things I wanted to modify on the game mod before the deadline.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next step should be to study the operation of the unity hub because modifying the modules in the game requires the use of unity. I think if I work with two classmates, we might try something new, such as changing the character models in the game. Rather than modifying the items and gold coins in the game.
